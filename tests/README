Run the Makefile in tests/CMU_malloc_test_driver to build the test driver. 
Then run 
./mdriver -v -t traces
to run all of the traces in the trace directory

Tracefile:

Format (based on data structures below)

First 4 lines: 
    trace->sugg_heapsize //Not used
    trace->num_ids
    trace->num_ops
    trace->weight
Following Lines:
    a/r/f index size //Note: in case of f, no size is included
